# How to Stream on Kick and YouTube at the Same Time: The Ultimate 2025 Guide

Live streaming is no longer about choosing just one platform. To maximize your reach and grow your community faster, broadcasting to multiple platforms at once—known as multistreaming—is the new standard. In 2025, two of the biggest destinations for streamers are the established giant, YouTube, and the rapidly growing, creator-first platform, Kick.

But how do you stream to both Kick and YouTube simultaneously without complicated software or a supercomputer? It's easier than you think. This guide will walk you through the two best methods to get your multistream live in minutes.

## What You'll Need to Get Started

Before diving into the setup, make sure you have the basics covered. A successful multistream depends on a solid foundation.

*   **A Decent Streaming PC:** Multistreaming, especially without a third-party service, can be more demanding on your CPU or GPU.
*   **A Stable Internet Connection:** This is crucial. Your upload speed is the most important factor. For a stable 1080p stream to two platforms, an upload speed of at least 10-15 Mbps is recommended. Run a speed test to check yours.
*   **Streaming Software:** We'll be focusing on **OBS Studio**, the free, open-source, and industry-standard software for streaming. These methods will also work with alternatives like Streamlabs Desktop.
*   **Kick and YouTube Accounts:** Ensure both accounts are set up and ready for live streaming. For YouTube, you may need to verify your account and wait 24 hours before you can go live for the first time.

## The Two Core Methods for Multistreaming in 2025

There are two primary ways to broadcast your stream to Kick and YouTube at the same time. Each has its pros and cons, catering to different needs and technical comfort levels.

1.  **Using an OBS Plugin:** This is the free, powerful method that gives you full control. It uses a plugin to send a second video feed directly from your computer.
2.  **Using a Restreaming Service:** This is the easiest, most convenient method. You stream once to a third-party service, which then duplicates and sends your stream to all your connected platforms.

Let's break down how to set up each one.

## Method 1: Multistreaming with the OBS "Multiple RTMP Outputs" Plugin

This is the preferred method for streamers who have a powerful PC and a strong upload speed. You handle all the encoding and broadcasting yourself, giving you maximum control without any extra cost or watermarks.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Primary Stream in OBS

First, configure OBS to stream to one of your primary platforms. Let's use YouTube as the example.

1.  Open OBS Studio and go to **File > Settings > Stream**.
2.  For the **Service**, select **YouTube - RTMPS**.
3.  The easiest way is to click **Connect Account (recommended)** and sign in with your Google account. This automatically pulls in your stream key and sets up a connection.
4.  Alternatively, you can select "Use Stream Key (advanced)" and manually paste your key from the YouTube Studio dashboard.
5.  Click **Apply**. Do not click OK yet.

### Step 2: Install the "Multiple RTMP Outputs" Plugin

Now it's time to add the magic component that makes multistreaming possible.

1.  Search for the "Multiple RTMP Outputs" plugin on the OBS Project official plugin page.
2.  Download the latest release for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
3.  Follow the installation instructions, which usually involve copying the downloaded files into your OBS Studio installation folder.
4.  Restart OBS Studio after installation. You should now see a new dockable window titled **"Multiple Outputs."** If you don't see it, go to **View > Docks** and ensure **"Multiple Outputs"** is checked.

### Step 3: Configure Your Kick Stream Output

With the plugin installed, you can now add Kick as your second destination.

1.  In the "Multiple Outputs" window, click **"Add new target."**
2.  A configuration window will pop up. For **Name**, type **"Kick."**
3.  Now, you need your Kick streaming info. Open a browser and go to your **Kick Creator Dashboard**.
4.  Navigate to **Settings > Stream Key**.
5.  Copy the **Stream URL** and paste it into the **RTMP Server** field in the OBS plugin settings.
6.  Copy your **Stream Key** from Kick and paste it into the **RTMP Key** field.
7.  Leave the video and audio settings on "(Get from OBS)" unless you are an advanced user who wants a different resolution or bitrate for your second output. This tells the plugin to use your main stream's settings.
8.  Click **OK**.

### Step 4: Going Live on Both Platforms!

This is the easy part. Your OBS is now configured to broadcast to both YouTube and Kick.

1.  In the main OBS controls, click **"Start Streaming."** This will send your stream to YouTube (your primary configured service).
2.  In the "Multiple Outputs" dock, click **"Start"** next to your "Kick" target.
3.  That's it! You are now live on both YouTube and Kick simultaneously, directly from your PC.

## Method 2: Using a Restreaming Service

If the plugin method seems too technical, or if you're worried about your PC's performance or internet bandwidth, a restreaming service is a fantastic alternative. Services like Restream.io, Castr, or aircast.pro simplify the process significantly.

### How These Services Work

Instead of your PC sending two separate streams, you send a single, high-quality stream to the restreaming service's servers. Their powerful servers then handle the work of duplicating and sending that stream to every platform you've connected, like Kick and YouTube.

### Step-by-Step Setup (Using Restream.io as an Example)

1.  Go to Restream.io and create a free account.
2.  From your dashboard, click **"Add Destination."**
3.  Select **YouTube** from the list and follow the prompts to authorize access to your account.
4.  Click **"Add Destination"** again. Select **Kick** from the list. You will need to paste your Kick Stream URL and Stream Key here, just as you would have for the OBS plugin.
5.  Once both destinations are added, Restream will display your unique **RTMP URL** and **Stream Key** at the top of the dashboard. Copy these.
6.  Go back to OBS Studio and navigate to **File > Settings > Stream**.
7.  For the **Service**, select **Restream.io - RTMP** (if available) or choose **Custom**.
8.  Paste the URL into the **Server** field and the key into the **Stream Key** field.
9.  Click **OK**.

Now, when you click **"Start Streaming"** in OBS, you'll send your single feed to Restream, and they will automatically broadcast it live to both your connected Kick and YouTube channels.

## Best Practices for a Successful Multistream

Going live is only half the battle. To create a great experience for both audiences, keep these tips in mind.

*   **Unify Your Chat:** The biggest challenge of multistreaming is managing two separate chat rooms. Use a tool like Restream's unified chat client or a free alternative like Social Stream to combine both chats into a single window or browser source that you can add to your stream. This way, you and your viewers can see all messages in one place.
*   **Engage Everyone:** Greet viewers from both platforms. When you see a message, you might say, "Thanks for the comment over on YouTube!" or "Welcome to the Kick crew!" This makes everyone feel included in one large community.
*   **Check Your Analytics:** After your stream, look at the analytics on both Kick and YouTube. Which platform had more viewers? Where did you get more engagement? Use this data to understand your audience and tailor your content strategy.

## Conclusion: Which Method Should You Choose?

So, which path is right for your 2025 streaming journey?

*   Choose the **OBS Plugin method** if you have a powerful streaming PC, a high-speed internet connection, and want a completely free solution with no third-party branding.
*   Choose a **Restreaming Service** if you want the absolute easiest setup, have a less powerful computer, or value convenient features like a built-in unified chat and consolidated analytics.

Whichever method you choose, multistreaming to Kick and YouTube is a proven strategy for growing your brand and reaching more people than ever before. Don't limit your potential to a single platform.
